  gpu               [int]  : The ID of the GPU on which the code run. GPU
                             list can be found in command 'nvidia-smi'.
  block_dim         [int]  : The number of threads in a single block.
                             The total number of threads is product of the
                             block_dim, block_per_sm, and the number of 
                             stream multiprocessor (SM). Here, the number 
                             of SM is determined by hardware specification.
  block_per_sm      [int]  : The number of block per stream multiprocessor.
                             If the metric 'Volatile GPU-Util' in the
                             'nvidia-smi' is not saturated, block_dim should
                             be increased to achieve peak performance.
  buffer_ratio      [float]: The ratio of memory share of particle and 
                             interaction buffer per total GPU memory capacity.
                             If the error caused by the buffer size is raised,
                             this parameter should be increased.
  block_decay_rate  [float]: The decay rate of the block of launched kernel 
                             at the residual stage. This parameter can be 
                             tuned heuristically to achieve peak performance.
                             Generally, this parameter should have a value 
                             close to 1 when activating a computationally 
                             intensive interaction (e.g. Doppler broadened 
                             Compton scattering).
  block_decay_limit [int]  : The lower bound on the number of the block in the 
                             launched kernel. When the decayed number of 
                             blocks become smaller than this limit, all
                             remained phase-space of each buffer will be 
                             discarded. Peak performance can be achieved by 
                             increasing this parameter, as small kernel launch
                             sizes degrade performance. However, accuracy may 
                             decrease because remaining particles are removed.
  seed              [int]  : Initial seed of the curand XORWOW random number
                             generator.
