  mode_high         [str]  : Ion-nuclear reaction model for the high 
                             energy ion (> 70 MeV/u). Possible options 
                             are followed as below;
                             
    1) off          -> Turn off the ion-nuclear reaction. If this option is
                       chosen, low energy ion-nuclear reaction model is in-
                       activated also.
    2) abrasion     -> Wilson abrasion model.
    3) qmd          -> Relativistic Jaeri quantum molecular dynamics.
                               
  mode_low          [str]  : Ion-nuclear reaction model for the high 
                             energy ion (< 70 MeV/u). Possible options 
                             are followed as below;
                             
    1) bme          -> Boltzmann master equation.
    2) incl         -> Compound nucleus formation model of 
                       Liege intranuclear cascade.
                                                 
  evap_cutoff       [float]: Evaporation time cutoff. If the lifetime of 
                             projectile ion is shorter than this parameter
                             and the excitation energy is zero, unstable-
                             breakup model is applied. Otherwise, projectile
                             ion is considered as stable nuclei. Note that 
                             the in-flight de-excitation is not supported.
  activate_fission  [bool] : Activate competitive fission evaporation branch.
  abrasion_ce       [bool] : If true, n-body energy conservation algorithm 
                             is applied to abrasion model. Otherwise, n-body
                             momentum conservation algorithm is applied.
                             Note that this option valid only in abrasion 
                             mode.
  abrasion_nn       [bool] : If this parameter is activated, nucleon-nucleon 
                             scattering algorithm is applied. Note that this 
                             option valid only in abrasion mode.
  use_exact_level   [bool] : Not supported now.
