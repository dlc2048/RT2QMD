  name              [str]  : The name of tally. This variable must be unique.
  part              [str]  : Particle namelist of tally filter. Possible
                             options are followed as below;
                             
    1) all          -> Scoring all particles
    2) photon, g    -> Photon
    3) neutron, n   -> Neutron
    4) ion, genion  -> Generic ion (include proton, deuteron ...)    
      
  escale            [str]  : Energy binning type of this tally. Possible
                             options are followed as below;
                             
    1) linear       -> The energy bin is linearly uniform.
    2) log          -> The energy bin is log uniform.

  erange            [float]: Lower and upper bound of energy bin [MeV/u]. 
                             Upper bound should be larger than lower bound.
  ne                [int]  : The number of energy bin. This value must be 
                             positive.
  dtheta            [float]: Polar angle of the estimator [degree]. 
                             Initial projectile direction is assume to 
                             z-axis aligned, and secondary particles are 
                             regard as azimuhal symmetry. Upper bound should
                             be larger than lower bound.
  ascii             [bool] : Write tally data as ASCII if true, as binary 
                             elsewhere.
  za                [int]  : A list of ZA filter of this estimator. This 
                             parameter is used when the 'part' include the 
                             generic ion. The format of this parameter is 
                             ZZZAAA. If A = 0, all particles matching the 
                             specified Z number will be scored. For example
                             '--za 1000 2000' scores all hydrogen and helium
                             isotopes.
